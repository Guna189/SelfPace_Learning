Write a python program implementing bubble sort.
```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
  """Bubble sort algorithm.

  Args:
    nums: List of numbers to be sorted.

  Returns:
    List of sorted numbers.
  """

  for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
    for j in range(len(nums) - 1 - i):
      if nums[j] > nums[j + 1]:
        nums[j], nums[j + 1] = nums[j + 1], nums[j]

  return nums


if __name__ == "__main__":
  nums = [5, 7, 3, 1, 2, 4]
  print(bubble_sort(nums))
```

explain about block-chain in 150 words
A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.

Blockchains are often used as a distributed ledger, where the data is stored across multiple nodes, making it impossible for any single user to alter the data. This makes blockchains an ideal technology for recording transactions, as it provides a secure and tamper-proof way to track ownership of digital assets.

explain about block-chain.
A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.

Because of the immutability of the data stored in blockchains, they are often used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, such as financial transactions, contracts, and other records.

Here are some of the key features of blockchains:

* **Decentralization:** Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network, which means that there is no central authority that controls the data. This makes blockchains more secure and resistant to attack than traditional databases.
* **Immutability:** Once data is added to a blockchain, it cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This makes blockchains a tamper-proof way of storing data.
* **Transparency:** All transactions on a blockchain are publicly visible, which makes it easy to track the flow of funds and identify suspicious activity.
* **Scalability:** Blockchains can be scaled to handle a large number of transactions. This makes them suitable for use in applications such as financial trading and supply chain management.

Blockchains are a powerful technology with a wide range of potential applications. They are still in their early stages of development, but they are already being used in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. As blockchain technology continues to mature, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in the digital economy.

Here are some of the benefits of using blockchain technology:

* **Security:** Blockchains are secure by design. The data stored in a blockchain is immutable, which means that it cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This makes blockchains a tamper-proof way of storing data.
* **Transparency:** All transactions on a blockchain are publicly visible, which makes it easy to track the flow of funds and identify suspicious activity. This transparency can help to improve trust and accountability in transactions.
* **Scalability:** Blockchains can be scaled to handle a large number of transactions. This makes them suitable for use in applications such as financial trading and supply chain management.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Blockchains are a cost-effective way to store data and process transactions. This is because they do not require a central authority to verify transactions, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.

Blockchain technology is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. It is likely to play an increasingly important role in the digital economy in the years to come.

what is python?
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is designed to be easy to read and write. Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is not declared at compile time but is instead inferred by the context in which it is used. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural programming.
