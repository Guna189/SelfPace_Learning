Revision on topic: Network Topologies

**Network Topologies**

A network topology is the arrangement of the physical or logical links between the nodes of a computer network. It defines how data flows through the network. There are many different network topologies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

**1. ** **Mesh topology**

In a mesh topology, each node is connected to every other node. This provides the most redundancy and fault tolerance, as if one link fails, data can still be routed through other links. However, mesh topologies are more expensive to implement and can be more difficult to manage.

**2. ** **Star topology**

In a star topology, all nodes are connected to a central hub. This is the simplest and most cost-effective topology to implement. However, if the hub fails, all nodes will be disconnected from the network.

**3. ** **Ring topology**

In a ring topology, each node is connected to two other nodes, forming a closed loop. Data flows in one direction around the ring. If one node fails, the data can still be routed through the other nodes. However, ring topologies are not as fault-tolerant as mesh topologies.

**4. ** **Tree topology**

A tree topology is a combination of a star and a bus topology. It has a central root node, with branches that extend out to other nodes. Tree topologies are easy to implement and manage, and they provide good fault tolerance.

**5. ** **Bus topology**

In a bus topology, all nodes are connected to a single shared bus. Data flows in one direction along the bus. Bus topologies are simple and cost-effective to implement, but they are not as fault-tolerant as other topologies.

**6. ** **Hybrid topology**

A hybrid topology is a combination of two or more different topologies. Hybrid topologies can be used to combine the advantages of different topologies and to overcome their disadvantages.

**7. ** **Physical topology**

The physical topology of a network refers to the way in which the nodes are physically connected to each other. The physical topology of a network can be either wired or wireless.

**8. ** **Logical topology**

The logical topology of a network refers to the way in which the nodes are logically connected to each other. The logical topology of a network can be different from the physical topology.

**9. ** **Broadcast domain**

A broadcast domain is a group of nodes that can receive broadcast messages from each other. In a bus topology, all nodes are in the same broadcast domain. In a star topology, each node is in its own broadcast domain. In a ring topology, all nodes are in the same broadcast domain. In a tree topology, nodes in the same branch are in the same broadcast domain. In a hybrid topology, the broadcast domains depend on the specific topology.

**10. ** **Collision domain**

A collision domain is a group of nodes that can collide with each other on a shared network medium. In a bus topology, all nodes are in the same collision domain. In a star topology, each node is in its own collision domain. In a ring topology, all nodes are in the same collision domain. In a tree topology, nodes in the same branch are in the same collision domain. In a hybrid topology, the collision domains depend on the specific topology.

**11. ** **Bandwidth**

The bandwidth of a network refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over the network in a given amount of time. The bandwidth of a network is determined by the physical media used and the network topology.

**12. ** **Latency**

The latency of a network refers to the delay between the transmission of a data packet and the reception of the data packet. The latency of a network is determined by the physical media used, the network topology, and the network traffic.

**13. ** **Throughput**

The throughput of a network refers to the average amount of data that can be transmitted over the network in a given amount of time. The throughput of a network is determined by the bandwidth, the latency, and the network traffic.

**14. ** **Scalability**

The scalability of a network refers to its ability to handle increasing amounts of traffic without a significant decrease in performance. The scalability of a network is determined by the physical media used, the network topology, and the network protocols.

**15. ** **Cost**

The cost of a network refers to the initial investment in hardware and software, as well as the ongoing costs of maintenance and operation. The cost of a network is determined by the physical media used, the network topology, and the network protocols.
